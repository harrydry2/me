  p March, 2020. Fitness instructor, Joe Wicks, was putting the finishing touches to his nationwide tour of UK schools.
  p Coronavirus hit. The schools closed. Joe’s tour was cancelled.
  p It looked like a disaster. But Joe had an idea.
  p He could be “the nation's P.E. teacher”. 30 minute workouts. Every morning. Live on YouTube.
  p Let's break down how Joe started a movement:
  h2.under 1) Start with why
  p Every movement starts with a!{' '}

    |. Joe's!{' '}
    span.italic why
    |!{' '}was to “take the pressure of parents during lockdown”.
  p People resonated with it. And it seperated him from the hundred other YouTubers doing live workouts.
  //- h2.under 1) Niche down
  //- p Every movement needs a focal point. Joe's was kids.
  //- p This gave his workouts a!{' '}
  //-   span.italic purpose
  //-   |!{' '}— “to keep kids active during lockdown”.
  //- p It seperated him from the hundreds of other YouTubers doing live workouts.
  h2.under 2) Give it a name
  p Joe had a!{' '}

    | . Now, he needed a name.
  p When you name something it sticks. “P.E. with Joe” was perfect.
  h2.under 3) Communicate with clarity
  //-   | . And make it as easy to consume as possible.
  //- p The next step was to deliver a clear message.
  //- p Every movement needs a clear message
  p The next step was delivering a clear message. And Joe's image was great:
  //- p The next thing a movement needs is a clear message. And Joe's was great:
  //- p The next step was to deliver a clear message.
  //- p The goal was to make it as easy to consume as possible. Video is long. Text is too boring. Image was Joe's medium of choice:

  p Any parent could look at it for two seconds, and understand what’s going on:
  h2.under 4) Spread the message
  p Next, Joe took to social media to rally his followers.
  p A great message is worthless unless you can spread it. Joe wasn't afraid of asking for help:
  p Alone, his reach was limited to his followers. But, if he could inspire his followers to pread the word, and he could reach 10x that:

  p Two things stand out:
  p.list.list__top • Joe puts parents at the center of his message. It's not about him.
  p.list.list__bottom • The sharing instructions are specific — “screenshot this and post it your wall”. People need spoon feeding.
  //- p Also, notice how specific Joe's instructions are — “screenshot this and post it your wall”. People need spoon feeding.
  h2.under 5) Create a bond
  p So, Joe did everything right. And 6 million kids tuned in for his first workout. The challenge was to keep them coming back.
  p Joe’s solution was “P.E. homework”. Kids submit on social media. He replies and shares the best ones.
  p Two weeks into his workouts, a million kids are still checking in.
