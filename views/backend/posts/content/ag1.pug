p There’s ONE way to buy Athletic Greens.
p You go on their homepage, you buy the welcome kit. Free shaker, free scooper, free delivery. Everything you need. One button to press. Idiot proof.
p But options are harmless, right? You'd rather a choice.

p Let me remind you of Trout & Reis's first immutable law of branding.
p.inwardSpeech “The power of your brand is inversely proportional to its scope.”
p Imagine AG1 mango. Or strawberry kiwi. Different sizes. Stick packs. “Let's make a bar”. Now it's just another nutrition company.
p But when Huberman et al. say “Drink AG1” it sticks. Don't make me think.
