p I’m sure a few of you have heard this story. But it’s worth telling again for those who haven’t.
p Back in 1998, when!{' '}

p Not only did it succeed in putting smiles on faces, people were so enamoured that they flocked to music forums and personal blogs to share the email. This led to discussion after discussion about CD Baby, plenty of valuable backlinks, and in Derek's words: “thousands of new customers.”
