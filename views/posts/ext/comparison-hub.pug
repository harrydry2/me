  p For any popular product, there’s always a bunch of people who are unhappy or who want to compare alternatives.
  p One nice trick is creating a comparison page targeting the “[your competitor name] + alternative” search term. For example, EmailOctopus has a “
    a(href="https://emailoctopus.com/mailchimp-alternative" target="_blank") Mailchimp alternative
    | ” page.
  p Even if the search volume is low it's one of the best terms to rank for because anyone Googling has an!{' '}
    span.bold intent to purchase
    | . A “[competitor] + alternative” page with!{' '}
    span.bold 50 / mo
    |!{' '}organic traffic might convert more paid users than a blog post with!{' '}
    span.bold 5000 / mo
    |!{' '}organic traffic.
  p
    a(href="https://podia.com/?ref=marketingexamples" target="_blank") Podia
    | , the online course platform, nails this strategy. Let’s run through it:
  h2 A hub of pages
  p The first area where Podia excels is volume. In total they have!{' '}
    span.bold 37
    |!{' '}“[competitor] + alternative” pages (all variations of the same template) pulling in!{' '}
    span.bold 5,500
    |!{' '}organic traffic / mo:
  img(src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrydry/gdmarketing/po1a.png" alt="Podia's Organic Traffic / mo").img__90
  p I like this strategy because once the first template is built the marginal cost of adding another is minimal.
  p It also allows Podia to hedge their bets. No matter which competitor becomes “the next big thing” Podia are ready to pinch any unhappy customers.
  h2 Antidote to pain
  p The beauty of “alternative” pages is they allow you to position yourself as the!{' '}
    span.bold antidote to your competitors' pain
    | . And Podia doesn't miss an opportunity:
  p
    span.bold 1)
    |!{' '}For each competitor, their!{' '}
    span.bold copy
    |!{' '}hits at the heart of why someone might want to migrate away.

  p
    span.bold 2)
    |!{' '}The categories in their!{' '}
    span.bold comparison table
    |!{' '}are handpicked (from a much larger pool) to best highlight each competitor's deficiencies.

  p
    span.bold 3)
    |!{' '}Even their!{' '}
    span.bold testimonials
    |!{' '}are targeted. For instance, the “Gumroad alternative” page showcases a customer who previously migrated from Gumroad:

  h2 Engage each user
  p Podia also do a great job of encouraging dialogue. On viewing one of their “alternative” pages a message appears reading:
  p.inwardSpeech Hey! 😊 Quick question: are you currently using [Competitor]?
  p The aim is to turn a!{' '}
    span.bold landing page visit
    |!{' '}into a!{' '}
    span.bold sales interaction
    | . I bet Spencer is well versed on each competitor's pain points.

  h2 Defend Territory
  p Finally, Podia have also built a “
    a(href="https://www.podia.com/podia-alternatives" target="_blank") Podia Alternative
    | ” page themselves where they compare the competition.
  p Given this page is on their domain it’s sure to come in at No 1 for the “Podia Alternative” search term.
  p This prevents competitors with “Podia Alternative” pages, strolling to the top of Google unchallenged, and pinching their own customers.
  h2 Results
  p Does Podia's strategy actually work? Well, to quote!{' '}
    a(href="https://anniemaguire.com/portfolio-items/podia-case-study/" target="_blank") Annie Maguire
    | , who wrote the copy for these pages, “they're converting visitors to trial accounts at!{' '}
    span.bold over 10%
    | .” So that is a resounding yes!
  h2 Summary
  p To summarise Podia’s execution:
  p.list.list__top 1) Create a “[your competitor name] + alternative” template
  p.list 2) Duplicate for all competitors
  p.list 3) Be the antidote to the pain your competitors bring
  p.list 4) Encourage dialogue with a targeted message popup
  p.list.list__bottom 5) Cover yourself by creating your own alternative page.
